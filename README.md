My First Coding Assignment with C++ (dimensions of a warehouse)

[This assignment requires you to calculate the cost to lay the bricks for a rectangular warehouse. Your program must find the cost of the bricks and the contractor’s fee to lay the bricks.]

The height of the warehouse is height feet. There are no walls inside the warehouse. 
The warehouse has doors but no windows. Each door has the same width and height. 
Doors are not to be counted when finding the number of bricks required.

PROGRAMMING REQUIREMENTS

Write a program to calculate the cost to lay the bricks for a rectangular warehouse based on the following specifications:

(1) Input the dimensions of the warehouse (width, length, and height) from the user at the keyboard.

(2) Input the number of doors in the warehouse and the width and height of the doors.

(3) Calculate the number of bricks required to build the warehouse based on the area of the walls to be constructed and the area of a brick.

(4) Add ten percent (10%) to the figure obtained in (3) to cater for broken bricks and cutting required around doors, edges, and corners.

(5) Bricks are sold in pallets. Each pallet contains 312 bricks. A customer must purchase an integer number of pallets. The cost of a pallet of bricks must be input from the user at the keyboard.

(6) Determine how many pallets of bricks must be purchased and the cost of the bricks.

(7) A contractor can lay 500 bricks per day. The contractor’s daily rate must be input from the user at the keyboard.

(8) Calculate the contractor’s fee to lay the bricks.

(9) Calculate the total cost to lay the bricks for the warehouse.

(10) Your program must generate output showing:

	-	The exact number of bricks required
	
	-	The number of bricks required accounting for wastage
	
	-	The number of pallets of bricks to be purchased
	
	-	The cost of the bricks
	
	-	The number of days the contractor will take and the contractor’s daily rate
	
	-	The contractor’s fee

	-	The total cost to lay the bricks for the warehouse
